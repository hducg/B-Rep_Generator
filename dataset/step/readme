Here are the dataset of CAD models in step file format. 
In the step file, each face is assigned an id.
Face labels are stored in another file with the same prefix as the step file and an extention name 'face_truth'.
For example, "1-7-10-11-19.step" represents the CAD model, and "1-7-10-11-19.face_truth" is the label file.
